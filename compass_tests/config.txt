Info: 
ODroid I2C Slave address: 0x00
Pins 8 and 9 are for a single I2C setup. We only need these for the compass. 
One is a clock or toggle, the other is a data flow. So 8 would be the clock and 9 would be the data. 

It also needs a GND and +3.3Vdc to +5Vdc pins. 

The compass will need to be calibrated in order for readings to be correct, the calibration python code will be added to this folder.
